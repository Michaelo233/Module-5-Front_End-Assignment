Hi Derek, I have decided that i will use 1 of my francs to claim the 
mark for my debugging analysis, but i will also do a narration of how
my code works, in other to complete the commit requirements.


- firstly, This api is like a tree inventory api, and it is just simple
to work through it, though i did not specifically make a table header 
for each output, but it has the treeid as the first column,  tree name as 
the second, botanical name as the third and neighbourhood as the forth column.

- Secondly, when you press the button without an input, it generally 
displays the data of the api.

- for the input, it is case sensitive, and you have to search using the 
tree name/type you want to be displayed.

- lastly, for the css, i used ai for the styles.


Thank you.
